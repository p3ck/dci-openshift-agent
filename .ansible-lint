  - literal-compare # Allow explicit comparison to True or False
  - meta-no-info # Allow omitting galaxy info.
  - ignore-errors # Allow ignore-errors: Linter is stupid and permits `failed_when: false` but disallows `ignore-errors`.

# These rules would be in the `warn_list` except that ansible-lint doesn't handle warnings sensibly.

  - var-naming # There's a LOT of uppercase vars, Consider enabling this rule later later
  - command-instead-of-shell # allow using `shell` as several required behaviours are not in modules.
  - empty-string-compare # empty string compare is OK when done correctly
